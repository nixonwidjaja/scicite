# GPT-2 Model for Scicite Text Classification

- `gpt.ipynb`: Evaluation of multiple GPT-2 models
- `pipeline.py`: Python script for training, evaluating, and saving the GPT-2 model
- `train_script.sh`: Shell script for training in SOC compute cluster
- `utils.py`: Contains various utility functions used in training

To run the `gpt.ipynb` properly, do the following:

1. Install the python requirement using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Download our trained models (gpt2-1.pth, gpt2-2.pth, gpt2-3.pth, and gpt2-4.pth) in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farreldwireswara/gpt-2-model-for-scicite-text-classification
